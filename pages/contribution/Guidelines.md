# How can I contribute?

The guidelines for balance between innovation and code stability.

> Ok, I have a new idea. Now, what's the right way to implement it to move FE in Ackee forward and let other team members benefit from that?

1. üí°**Idea validation**

   New ideas are very much welcomed. However, the team has to maintain its solid base that is built on. Therefore, the new idea must respect:

   - [team values and goals](https://trello.com/b/tnr6JKtk/c%C3%ADle-vize-a-hodnoty-t%C3%BDmu),
   - [our stack [To Do]](/pages/application-stack),
   - [our good practices [To Do]](/pages/BestPractices.html) and rest of this frontend cookbook.

2. ‚è≥**Rought time estimate**

   Next step is to make at least a rough time estimate:

   - <5h - No need to get any approval.
   - 5-20h - An approval by your team leader required.
   - \>20h - An approval from with higher management required.

3. ü§ì**Consultation with expert**

   Consider discussing your idea with a team expert for that given thing based on the [Responsible matrix](https://frontend.ack.ee/responsibility-matrix). You might save a lot of time to yourself by receiving valuable feedback early on.

4. ‚úÖ**The things that should be included**

   - A **documentation**  each member can understand. Otherwise barely anyone will use it then. The form can be readme, next cookbook chapter or fully featured documentation with its own domain.

   - **Tests** are heavily recommended. Don't forget it'll be your new responsibility, so this will save you time in the future.

5. üßë‚Äçüè´**Presenting it to the team**

   Remember that other team members have to use it and first of all have to know how to use it.

   Even though sharing the docs with your team could seem to be a good idea, imagine how many Slack messages you've ignored or missed. So maybe, it'd be a better idea to introduce it as [another topic during weekly FE meetings](https://frontend.ack.ee/).

6. üßë‚Äçüíª**Use it on a client project**

   Now, the only thing missing is to find the right time to use it on client projects.

   The beginning or some major breaking point could be the right time. Definitly, it wouldn't be a good idea to switch on that during a running sprint.
