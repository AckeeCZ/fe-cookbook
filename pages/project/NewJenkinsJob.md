# Build project using Jenkins

This recipe describes how to setup Jenkins to automatically build project and deploy it to GS bucket. 
It consists of few steps made in Jenkins, Gitlab & repository.

## Add Jenkinsfile to project

Take the content below and put it to file called `Jenkinsfile` located in root of your repository.

```
PipelineReact {
  slackChannel = '#ci-web'
  buildCommand = [
      development: 'npm install && npm test && npm run build:dev',
      master:      'npm install && npm test && npm run build:prod',
  ]
  buildDir = 'build'
  
  baseURL = 'template-react'
  bucketURL = [
      master:      "gs://${baseURL}.ack.ee/",
      development: "gs://${baseURL}-development.ack.ee/",
      stage:       "gs://${baseURL}-stage.ack.ee/"
  ]

  cloudProject = [
      development: 'infrastruktura-1307',
      master:      'ackee-production',
  ]

  nodeEnv = '-e NODE_PATH=./app:./config'
  nodeImage = 'node:6'
  excludeDir = '.git'
}
```

### Config fields

**PipelineReact** - Name of function in groovy script which manages the pipeline.

### Change these fields for project

* **slackChannel** - Set name of Slack channel for sending build result into. Create project specific channel (eg. `#ci-petshare`) or left default `#ci-web` channel - but it's not recommended.  

* **buildCommand** - Add set of terminal commands that will run on build trigger.  

* **baseURL**, **beucketURL** - Git branches that are required to build and adresses to deploy them.

* **cloudProject** - Id of cloud project where branch is deployed. Ask DevOps for these.

### Change these if you need

* **build** - Folder where pipeline will look for built project files and use them for deploy.

* **nodeImage** - Name of docker image which will be used as a build environment.

## Create new job

1. Go to ackee jenkins websites.

2. Press **NovÃ©** button in top left corner.  
![New Jenkins job](../img/NewJenkinsJob/new_job.png) 

3. Fill then first input field with your project name.

4. Now there are two options to create job
   * Create multipipeline branch from the scratch by clicking **Multibranch pipeline**.  
   ![New multibranch pipeline](../img/NewJenkinsJob/multibranch_pipeline.png)  

   * Recommended way is to create it by cloning existing job and changing few settings (you can use eg. `abibuch/abibuch-editor-frontend` job). Just scroll to the bottom of page and fill the "Copy from" field with name of job you want to clone. 
  ![Clone job](../img/NewJenkinsJob/copy_pipeline_from.png)  

5. After confirm and getting to job configuration page, change the field **Project repository**. Then setup branches which will be scanned for changes by writing their names (separated by single space) into **Behaviours -> Discover branches -> Include** field, eg. `master development stage`.
![Configure job](../img/NewJenkinsJob/job_configuration_new.png) 

6. Decide if `master` branch should been build automatically or only by manual triggering, it's __Supress automatic SCM triggering__ option.

## Setup weboohok

Build webhook URL by replacing **GROUP_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME** with your project's Gitlab group and repository name in followring URL pattern:  

When you don't know the webhooks looks like - look into different project :) 

In gitlab repository go to **Settings -> Integration** page and field the URL field with hook adress from previous step, then click Add webhook and check **Enable SSL verification** option is checked.
